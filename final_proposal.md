# Anime Recommender

## Objective

The main goal of this project is to help people discover their next favorite anime. One way to do this requires a large quantity of users and reviews to accomplish this. However, this project aims to provide recommendations primarily on the characteristics of an anime, like genre, tags, studio, staff, and actors.  

## Previous Work

## My Approach

## Potential Impact

Anime is a global phenomenom with a massive following. This project has the potential to convert people into fans and it has the potential to help dedicated fans easily find more shows that they'll love without having to sift through thousands of titles.  

## Result Format

An ambitious goal for this project is to create a website/app for people to interact with and find recommendations. The front page will be simple and intuitive. The output will prioritize quality over quantity. I would also like for the app to teach people about their favorite anime and reveal trends they may not have noticed themselves, such as a common studio or director.  

## Data Sources

The data will be retrieved from the AniList API. If everything goes well, there will be more than 10,000 anime, up to 14,500. If I could collect similar data on non-anime I could do a better job at making recommendations for people who have never seen any anime before. Also, I could benefit from a thorough sentiment analysis of user reviews, but that is data I will not be able to retrieve and that is a project by itself.  

## Challenges

My data will come with tags for a show and a rating for how well the tag describes the show, but I am not familiar with how the tags are created. I need learn as much as I can about the methodology and I need to make some decisions about these tags. Some are accurate and some are not.  
Mentioned earlier, I would benefit from having more descriptors. These descriptors could could be generated from reviews. I don't expect I'll have this information for my project so I will have to do the best I can without it.  
There will be many feature for this dataset and I need to figure out how I am going to engineer them. Each feature falls into a category and I don't believe each category should have the same weight. More specifically, the weight of a category would ideally be adjusted for each user. For example, some people might strongly favor a specific genre and some people might strongly favor the work of a specific director.  

## To-Do

My next steps include collecting my data, cleaning and exploring the data, and removing outliers and problem data. After that is getting a minimum viable product up and running and then beginning the process of refining the product.
